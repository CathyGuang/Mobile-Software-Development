Traveler’s log
Cathy Guang, Ayla Kurdak, Haruna Suzuki

We created a personalized application where users can update their own “world map” after traveling to a country/city. After logging in, a world map will be displayed, while only countries that the user has commented on will be highlighted. When the user is travelling in a particular country, say Hungary, she or he can add daily diary entries or photos to record whatever thoughts the user has. Ratings for cities are also supported. 

The app also have a menu that displays the list of wishes/thoughts of places to go next. Also, a “friends” feature may be supported in the future so that users can see where their friends have been to.
